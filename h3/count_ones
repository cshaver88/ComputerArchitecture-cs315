#
# Program to read in a positive or negative number and return 
# the number of 1's in the binary representation of the number
#  input == -5 
#       ~0101---the binary number of 5
#       1010  (1's compliment)
#       1010 + 1( 2's compliment)
#       1011 (this is -5)   31 cuz 1's go in front of 1011
#       count them up and you get 31
