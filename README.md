h2: a + b MIPS
    Read in two ints a and b from the console.
    Check if a < b then compute the sum a +(a+1)+(a+2)+...+b.
    Check if a = b then compute a.
    Check if a > b then compute 0.
    After calculating print result and exit.
    
    fib MIPS
    A MIPS program that computes the nth Fibonacci number and print the result.

h3: bin_search
    Binary search through list and find key if it is there.
    
    count_ones
    Program to read in a positive or negative number and return the number of 1's in the binary representation of the number
    
    fibo_recursive
    Program to read a positive integer n, and compute the nth fibonacci number recursively

h5: compute.c
    Linux program that subtracts two user-input long ints then adds another to that result.  

    compute.s
    x86 assembly function for computation.

h6: bubble.c
    Use bubble sort to sort a list of ints.

    bubble.s
    x86 assembly function for computation.
    
    fibo.c
    Compute the nth Fibonacci number.
    
    fibo.s
    x86 assembly function for computation.
    
    recursive.c
    Print values of the function R(i, j) defined by:
    R(i,j) = i - j, if i or j is < 0
    R(i,j) = R(i-1, j) + R(i, j-1)

    recursive.s
    x86 assembly function for computation.
    
h7: locks.s
    x86 version of a locking mechanism for code.
    
    minuend.c
    Loops to calculate different arrays of information.
    
    pth_msg_sem.c
    Sync issue illustration.
    
    pth_sem.s
    x86 version of sync issues.

h8: Compare the performance of the hardware multiply, the basic algorithm outlined in the text in Figure 3.4, 
    and a proposed algorithm.  All three algorithms use unsigned ints.
